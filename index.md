Welcome the North Carolina Modeling Infectious Diseases (NC MInD) Project! Our [multidisciplinary team](https://www.rti.org/insights/north-carolina-modeling-infectious-diseases-nc-mind-program-our-innovative-modeling-plan) of epidemiologists, data scientists, public health practitioners, and health professionals has developed a geospatially explicit agent-based model for North Carolina. This model simulates the movement of agents, which represent patients, among healthcare facilities, including short-term acute care hospitals (STACHs), long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs), nursing homes, and the community in North Carolina. We incorporated disease states for COVID-19 and various healthcare-associated infections, including those caused by *Clostridioides difficile* and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, into the model. We used healthcare facility-level details (e.g., number of acute beds and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, admission rates) to calibrate the model, with agent movement informed by age, presence of comorbidities, and North Carolina home county of residence. This model was originally developed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Modeling Infectious Diseases [(MInD) Healthcare Network](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/research/MIND-Healthcare.html).*
